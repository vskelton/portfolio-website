      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <img src="img/Mainview.png" width="700px" alt="Screenshot of the myFlix movie app main view" class="screenshot">
      <p>The myFlix movie app is a single-page web application that provides users with access to information about
        movies, directors, and genres</p>
      <p>Users can create a profile, login, and view movie information such as, the genre, the description, and the
        director of the movie. Users are also able to update their profile information and add and remove movies from
        their favorites list.</p>
      <p></p>

      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To create a single-page web application that allows users to view and interact with movie data.</li>
        <li>To implement user authentication and profile management.</li>
        <li>To provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Technical Details</h2>
      <h3>Tools & Technologies Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>React.js for building the user interface</li>
        <li>Redux for state management</li>
        <li>Node.js and Express for the backend server</li>
        <li>MongoDB for the database</li>
        <li>RESTful API for data communication</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Application Architecture</h3>
      <p>The application follows a client-server architecture where the React frontend communicates with the Node.js
        backend via RESTful API endpoints. The backend handles data storage and retrieval from MongoDB.</p>

      <h3>Component Structure</h3>
      <p>The application is structured into several components, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MainView</strong>: The main component that renders the application.</li>
        <li><strong>MovieView</strong>: Displays a list of movies.</li>
        <li><strong>MovieCard</strong>: Shows detailed information about a selected movie.</li>
        <li><strong>ProfileView</strong>: Allows users to view and update their profile information.</li>
        <li><strong>LoginView</strong>: Handles user authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>SignupView</strong>: Allows new users to register.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>API Integration</h3>
      <p>The application interacts with a RESTful API to fetch movie data, user profiles, and handle authentication.</p>

      <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
      <p>One of the main challenges was ensuring secure user authentication and data handling. This was addressed by
        implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication.</p>
      <p>Another challenge was managing state across the application, which was resolved by using Redux for efficient
        state management.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
      <p>Future improvements could include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding more advanced search and filter functionalities for movies.</li>
        <li>Implementing a review system for users to rate and review movies.</li>
        <li>Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The myFlix movie app successfully provides users with a platform to explore and interact with movie data. The
        application is built using modern web technologies, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.</p>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <img src="img/Mainview.png" width="700px" alt="Screenshot of the myFlix movie app main view" class="screenshot">
      <p>The myFlix movie app is a single-page web application that provides users with access to information about
        movies, directors, and genres.</p>
      <p>Users can create a profile, login, and view movie information such as, the genre, the description, and the
        director of the movie. Users are also able to update their profile information and add and remove movies from
        their favorites list.</p>
      <p>My role for this project was to create the server-side and client-side from scratch and link both together to have a complete web
        application.</p>
      <p>The duration of the this project took about 2 weeks. I spent one week working on the server-side and creating
        the database for the movies. The second week I spent working on the client side of the project, creating the
        different views and adding the API Intergration to have a complete full-stack project.</p>

      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To create a single-page web application that allows users to view and interact with movie data.</li>
        <li>To implement user authentication and profile management.</li>
        <li>To provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.</li>
        <li>To utilize modern web technologies for both the client-side and server-side development.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Details</h2>
      <h3>Tools & Technologies Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>React.js for building the user interface</li>
        <li>Redux for state management</li>
        <li>Node.js and Express for the backend server</li>
        <li>MongoDB for the database</li>
        <li>RESTful API for data communication</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Application Architecture</h3>
      <h4>Server-side</h4>
      <p>I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API interacts with a non-relational database, MongoDB.
        The server handles requests for movie data, user profiles, and authentication. The API can be accessed via
        commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST.
        To test the API, I used Postman to send requests and verify the responses. I also included user authentication
        and authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authenticationand JWT authentication
      </p>

      <h4>Client-Side</h4>
      <p>After finishing the server-side, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, and
        receiving responses from the server-side.
        The client-side is built using React.js, which allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface. I used React
        Router to manage navigation between different views of the application.
        The client-side communicates with the server-side API to fetch movie data and user profiles. I also implemented
        Redux for state management, allowing for efficient data handling across components.
      </p>


      <h3>Component Structure</h3>
      <p>The application is structured into several components, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MainView</strong>: The main component that renders the application.</li>
        <li><strong>MovieView</strong>: Displays a list of movies.</li>
        <li><strong>MovieCard</strong>: Shows detailed information about a selected movie.</li>
        <li><strong>ProfileView</strong>: Allows users to view and update their profile information.</li>
        <li><strong>LoginView</strong>: Handles user authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>SignupView</strong>: Allows new users to register.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>API Integration</h3>
      <p>The application interacts with a RESTful API to fetch movie data, user profiles, and handle authentication.</p>

      <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
      <p>Future improvements could include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding more advanced search and filter functionalities for movies.</li>
        <li>Implementing a review system for users to rate and review movies.</li>
        <li>Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The myFlix movie app successfully provides users with a platform to explore and interact with movie data. The
        application is built using modern web technologies, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.</p>

      <p>This project helped reinforce the importance of planning component architecture before implementation.
        I also gained valuable experience in full-stack development, from setting up the server-side API to creating a
        dynamic client-side application.
      </p>

      <p>This project helped improve my skills in building single-page applications, implementing user authentication, integrating front-end applications with RESTful APIs, along with many other skills.</p>

      <h2> Project Overview</h2>
      <img src="img/pokedex1.png" width="700px" alt="PokeDex Screenshot" class="screenshot">
      <p>The PokeDex is a single page web application that allows users to view a list of Pokemon. Users are also able
        to view additional details of the Pokemon.</p>
      <p>My role for the project was to create a web application that fetched the PokeDex API with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. I also implemented Bootstrap to help
        make the application responsive.
      </p>
      <p>The duration of the project took me about one week to complete. Since JavaScript was completely new to me, I
        made sure to take my time learning how to use it and create a responsive web appplication.
        This project was built as part of my coursework through CareerFoundry.</p>

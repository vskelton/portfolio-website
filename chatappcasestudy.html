      <h2> Project Overview</h2>
      <img src="img/Chatapphome.png" class="screenshot" width="500px" alt="Home screen for Chat app">
      <p>The New Chat App is a custom-built mobile chat application developed using React Native and Expo. This project
        addresses the need for a simple yet feature-rich communication tool, enabling users to engage in real-time text
        conversations,
        easily share photos directly from their gallery or camera, and transmit thier precise location.
      </p>
      <p>My role encompassed the complete mobile application lifecycle, from the initial concept and UI/UX design
        considerations in React Native to integrating Google Firestore Databse for persistent chat data and ensuring
        cross-platform functionality.
        This app showcases my ability to build interactive and responsive mobile experiences.

      <h2>Problem & Opportunity</h2>
      <p>Recognizing the growing demand for efficient mobile communication tools, I identified an opportunity to create
        a chat application that not only supports text messaging but also enhances user interaction through multimedia
        sharing and location services.
        The goal was to develop a user-friendly app that could serve as a reliable platform for personal and group
        conversations, while also being accessible on both iOS and Android devices.</p>

      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a cross-platform mobile chat application using React Native and Expo.</li>
        <li>Enable users to send images from the gallery.</li>
        <li>Allow users to capture and send photos directly from the camera.</li>
        <li>Implement location sharing functionality to send the user's current location.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Process & Development</h2>
      <h3>1. Planning and Research</h3>
      <p>I started by outlining the core features of the chat application and researching best practices for mobile app
        development with React Native. I also explored various libraries for image handling and location services to
        ensure a smooth user experience.</p>
      <h3>2. Implementation</h3>
      <p>The application was built using React Native, leveraging Expo for rapid development and testing. I implemented
        Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval, allowing users to send and receive messages
        instantly. The app's UI was designed with a focus on simplicity and usability, ensuring that users could easily
        navigate through conversations, send images, and share their location with minimal effort.</p>
      <h3>3. Testing</h3>
      <p>Throughout the development process, I conducted extensive testing on both iOS and Android devices to ensure
        consistent performance and functionality. This included testing the image upload feature, location sharing, and
        overall app responsiveness. I also gathered feedback from peers to refine the user interface and enhance the
        overall user experience.</p>

      <h2>Challenges & Soultions</h2>
      <p>Developing the New Chat App presented several challenges that required innovative solutions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Challenge: Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensuring the app functioned seamlessly on both iOS and Android
          devices was a significant challenge.
          <br>
          Solution: I utilized React Native's cross-platform capabilities and tested extensively on both platforms to
          identify and resolve any inconsistencies.
        </li>
        <li>Challenge: Real-Time Data Synchronization: Implementing real-time messaging with Firebase Firestore required
          careful management of data flow.
          <br>
          Solution: I used Firestore's real-time listeners to ensure that messages were updated instantly across all
          devices, providing a smooth user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
